# hutao's Library
**Rifk7 does not support the require function for loading libraries at the moment, if you want to use it, please copy and paste this library**
    
This is the library for Rifk7 developers    
If you have a look at the script area from the beginning to now, you will see that I deleted all the libraries    
Not because of anything, just because when I wanted to maintain a library, I had to run to a special post to edit it, and I was too lazy to do that, so I decided to consolidate it and put it in a lua for use    
So, I hope you like it!
